# Computational Physics Homework 2

This repository contains my solutions to Homework 2 of Computational Physics. These can be found in the folder titled 'code2'

## Contents

- `code2/`
  - `overrelax.py`: Explores the use of over-relaxation techniques for speeding up the convergence of simple iterative functions.
  - 'wien.py`: Utilizes binary search to find the root of a simple equation in order to find Wien's Displacement Constant.
  - `graddescent.py`: Implements gradient descent algorithm in order to minimze chi squared fit of Schechter Function to COSMOS SMF data.
    
- 'data2/' contains two csv files which display iteration history from the algorithms in 'overrelax.py' and 'graddescent.py'

- 'smf_cosmos.dat' is simply the data provided for Problem 3.

- 'plots2/' contains all of the generated plots in my write-up.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
